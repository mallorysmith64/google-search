1,This month marks milestone birthdays and birth anniversaries of some of Indian cinema’s legendary stars.
2,"Superstar actor Rajinikanth, widely regarded as a pop culture phenomenon, turned 75 on December 12. His unique mannerisms, which include flipping a cigarette and twirling a pair of sunglasses, helped make films such as Billa, Sivaji, and Enthiran hits. Rajinikanth (pictured below) inspires extreme levels of adulation among fans, who herald the release of his films by dancing to drumbeats, lighting fireworks, and performing pujas that involve pouring milk onto cutouts of the star. Many actors have paid tribute to him in their own films. Among them is action hero Salman Khan, who also has a big birthday coming up—he turns 60 on December 27."
3,"Dharmendra, who died last month, would have been 90 on December 8. He was one of the leading Bollywood stars of the 1960s and ’70s and appeared in films such as the iconic Sholay. Method actor extraordinaire Dilip Kumar would have been 103 on December 11 and pioneering actor-director Raj Kapoor would have been 101 on December 14. Kumar’s Mughal-e-Azam, released in 1960 and costarring Madhubala, is counted among the greatest Indian films ever made. Kapoor was hugely popular in the Soviet Union and the Middle East and belonged to a film dynasty that has produced some of Bollywood’s most successful stars. He was celebrated in the documentary Dining with the Kapoors, which was released last month and featured his grandchildren Kareena Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor, as well as other members of the family."
