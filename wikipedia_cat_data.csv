For the cat family, see , requiring a predominantly meat-based diet. Its retractable is evident in its ability to adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems. . Today, the domestic cat occurs across the globe and is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill events. Out of the estimated 600 million domestic cats worldwide, 400 million reside in leads in cat ownership with 73.8 million cats, followed by the with approximately 10.9 million cats. It also ranges freely as a , avoiding human contact. Pet abandonment contributes to increasing of the global feral cat population, which has driven the decline of , which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century. The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then into Greek, Syriac, and Arabic. The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from , is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from ), a term interchangeable with the now-obsolete word International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature was sampled worldwide and considered to have probably descended from the In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce, following the recommendation of Gentry et al. (2004) that names based on domestic forms be used for domestic derivatives of wild species, regarded the domestic cat as a distinct species, Skulls of a wildcat (top left), a housecat (top right), and a hybrid between the two (bottom center) research shows that the wild members of this genus evolved through Phylogenetic relationships of the domestic cat as derived through analysis of in an Egyptian tomb dating to the 15th century BCE. , dating to about 7500–7200 BCE. Since there is no evidence of native mammalian on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in By the 5th century BCE, it was a familiar animal around settlements in in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a independently in China around 5500 BCE. This line of a partially domesticated cat left no trace in the domestic cat populations of today. During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wild. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, and high intelligence. Their rigorous grooming habits and instinct to bury their bodily waste make them generally much less messy than other domesticated animals. Captive cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but are not domesticated. revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication, as specific Most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic cats. of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious Hybridization between domestic and other Felinae species It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females. Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb). (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head. The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large for killing and tearing prey, can stab between two of the prey's Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae. pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, because cats' small cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication. Cats tend to have better dental health than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of , a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar. Nonetheless, they are subject to occasional tooth loss and infection. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws, such as in hunting, fighting, climbing, , or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth ""finger"". This special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits ("" . It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg. that alternates both legs together on each side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a ""diagonal"" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously. A cat is perched on a tree branch, having climbed up for exploration, escape, or hunting. Cats are generally fond of perching in high places. This may be a concealed hunting site such as a tree branch, for domestic cats to pounce upon prey. They favor a superior observation point over territory. A cat falling from up to 3 m (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws. During a lofty fall, a cat reflexively twists and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the A cat always rights itself in the same way, and it has enough time in falls of at least 90 cm (3.0 ft). The cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offspring. The domestic cat genes were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this gene to perform . The domestic cat family demonstrated a cosegregation between the and can see at one sixth the light level required for human vision. back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. , optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited. A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the might be due to a third type of cone. This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true , allowing them to blink without hindering their vision. The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5 Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the , which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It can detect Research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of familiar people's locations based on hearing their voices. Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of . It allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot. Cats are sensitive to Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain , which they can detect at less than one part per billion. About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone. This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine ( ; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors. that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste But they do have taste bud receptors specialized for such as the constituents of protein, and bitter tastes. Cats' taste buds possess the receptors needed to detect . However, these receptors contain molecular changes that make them taste umami differently from humans. In humans, they detect the amino acids : ""the specific combination of the high IMP and free histidine contents of tuna, which produces a strong umami taste synergy that is highly preferred by cats."" One researcher said, ""I think umami is as important for cats as sweet is for humans."" Cats distinctly prefer food temperature around 38 °C (100 °F), similar to a fresh kill. Some cats reject cold food, which would signal to the cat that the prey is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing. The whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch. To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents. They trigger protective Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night. Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes, but they can range a radius of many hundreds of meters. They establish that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging 7–28 ha (17–69 acres). The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied; but being low-light predators, they are generally , which means they tend to be more active near dawn and dusk. However, house cats' behavior is also influenced by human activity, and they may adapt to their owners' sleeping patterns to some extent. Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 to 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. The term ""cat nap"" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period. Short periods of are often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming. Behavioral and personality traits depend on a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Scientific evidence is mixed about the popular belief that those traits are linked to coat colors. The social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by , rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and , and, if that does not work, by short and violent, noisy attacks. Because cats do not have a social survival strategy or Two kittens lying side by side, an instinctive behavior that offers both comfort and protection Life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. , a cat's human keeper functions as a mother surrogate. Adult cats live in a type of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral . Their high-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly difficult for humans to ignore. Some pet cats are poorly socialized. In particular, older cats may show aggressiveness toward newly arrived kittens, which includes biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression. is a common form of aggression that can occur in multiple cat households. In redirected aggression, a cat is usually agitated by a stimulus such as a sight, sound, or other trigger that causes heightened anxiety or arousal; if the cat cannot attack the original stimulus, it may redirect its aggression toward the nearest cat, pet, human, or other being. behavior toward humans or other cats is thought to be a feline means of social bonding. , hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing. , including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms; a raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicate hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's , with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by , which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head. may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signaling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and kittens, who are thought to use it as a care-soliciting signal. Post-nursing cats also often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating. Although purring is popularly interpreted as indicative of pleasure, it has been recorded in a wide variety of circumstances, most of which involve physical contact between the cat and another, presumably trusted individual. Some cats have been observed to purr continuously when chronically ill or in apparent pain. The exact mechanism by which cats purr has long been elusive, but it has been proposed that purring is generated via a series of sudden build-ups and releases of pressure as the in control of the glottis are thought to be driven by a which generates a cycle of contraction and release every 30–40 Domestic cats observed in rescue facilities have 276 morphologically distinct based on 26 facial movements; each facial expression corresponds to different social functions that are probably influenced by domestication. Facial expressions have helped researchers detect pain in cats. The feline 's five criteria—ear position, orbital tightening, muzzle tension, whisker change, and head position—indicated the presence of acute pain in cats. Cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean. The cat's tongue has backward-facing spines about 0.5 millimeter long, called The papillae act like a hairbrush, and some cats, particularly , occasionally regurgitate sausage-shaped 2–3 cm (0.8–1.2 in) long of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming. Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the , and regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush. Cat intelligence refers to a cat's ability to solve problems, adapt to its environment, learn new behaviors, and communicate its needs. Structurally, a cat's brain shares similarities with the human brain, containing around 250 million neurons in the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for complex processing. allowing their brains to reorganize based on experiences. They have well-developed memory retaining information for a decade or longer. These memories are often intertwined with emotions, allowing cats to recall both positive and negative experiences associated with specific places. and problem-solving, studies conclude that they struggle with understanding cause-and-effect relationships in the same way that humans do. study is mostly from consideration of the domesticated cat. Living in urban environments has exposed them to challenges that require adaptive behaviors, contributing to cognitive development. Selective breeding and genetic changes have further influenced their intelligence. learn essential survival skills by observing their mothers, while adult cats refine their abilities through Kittens aged 14 weeks use fighting as a form of play. Domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. , both with each other and with humans. This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and it might also reduce the fear that they associate with launching attacks on other animals. Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry. Owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest. They become String is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cat's tongue and then move into the , a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death. The shape and structure of cats' cheeks is insufficient to allow them to take in liquids using suction. Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew, drawing water upward into their mouths. Feral cats and free-fed house cats consume several small meals in a day. The frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. They select food based on its temperature, smell, and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats reject novel flavors (a response termed It is also a common misconception that all cats like milk or cream, as they tend to avoid sweet food and milk. Most adult cats are ; the sugar in milk is not easily digested and may cause soft stools or Some also develop odd eating habits and like to eat or chew on things such as wool, plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, , can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten. Other common small creatures, such as lizards and snakes, may also become prey. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or The strategy used depends on available prey, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds. in the United States, killing an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals annually. Certain species appear more susceptible than others; in one English village, for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality was linked to the domestic cat. ) in Britain, 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as , which prey on cats and other small predators, reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. One explanation is that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the , in which humans are reacted to as if they are at or near the top. Another explanation is that they attempt to teach their guardians to hunt or to help their human as if feeding ""an elderly cat, or an inept kitten"". This hypothesis is inconsistent with the fact that male cats also bring home prey, though males have negligible involvement in raising kittens. Domestic males are more likely to fight than females. is competition between two males to mate with a female, and most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. decreases or eliminates this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to When cats become aggressive, they try to appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways, hissing, or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. Cats may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponents. Fights usually consist of grappling, slapping the face and body with the forepaws, and bites. Cats throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their hind legs. Serious damage is rare, because the fights are usually short, with the loser fleeing with scratches to the face and ears. More severe fights for mating rights may give deep punctures and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections from scratches and bites. Bites are probably the main route of transmission of the Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights and have battered faces. Cats are willing to threaten animals larger than them to defend their territory, such as dogs and When cats mate, the tomcat (male) bites the scruff of the female's neck as she assumes a position conducive to cycles during a year, lasting usually 21 days. They are usually ready to mate between early February and August in northern temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions. Several males, called tomcats, are attracted to a female in heat. They fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually, the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's , which are about 1 mm (0.04 in) long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines may provide the female with increased sexual stimulation, which acts to In this radiography of a pregnant cat, the skeletons of two fetuses are on the left and right of the uterus. thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female attacks him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat. Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. ; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers. forms 124 hours after conception. At 148 hours, early of queens lasts between 64 and 67 days, with an average of 65 days. Based on a study of 2,300 free-ranging queens conducted from May 1998 and October , with an average of three kittens. They produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year. Of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents. The first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age. Queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months, and males at 5–7 months. This varies depending on breed. Cats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their mother. ) as early as seven weeks to limit unwanted reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, (spraying urine) in males, and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed before In the United States, about 80% of household cats are neutered. The average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. In the early 1980s, it was about 7 years, and an average of about 13 years as of 2014 and 2023. Neutering increases life expectancy; one study found castrated male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. confers some health benefits, such as a greater life expectancy and a decreased incidence of reproductive Pre-pubertal neutering (neutering at 4 months or earlier) was only recommended by 28% of American veterinarians in one study. Some concerns of early neutering were metabolic, retarded have been identified in cats; many are similar to human of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as Diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms, ticks, and fleas. affects how they care for their cats. For example, people with greater knowledge about cats are less likely to use in cats is common and can result from several sources: plants that are toxic to cats, not intended for cats, foods unsuitable for cats, and household substances such as pesticides and paint thinners. . Medication poisoning occurs when cats ingest drugs intended for human use but toxic to cats, such as , as well as vitamin capsules formulated for humans or certain flea treatments designed for dogs (cats should be kept away from a dog treated with these products for 24 hours). Foods dangerous to cats include Many professional organizations have published guidelines for the proper and safe care of cats. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) has published a general guide emphasizing proper cat care. changed daily, routine grooming including brushing the , regular and odor-free litter box maintenance, and regular veterinary care, recommending that cats undergo a routine veterinary check-up at least once a year. In addition to the general guide, there are specific guides for proper grooming, The American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) and the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM) released a guide on the environmental The guide focuses on five main aspects: providing a safe private space for the cat (e.g., a box on its side, placed in a high location, and in sufficient numbers if multiple cats are present); offering multiple environmental resources (several feeding stations, resting areas and litter boxes, and separating food from water); opportunities for play and activities that simulate (using appropriate toys and puzzle feeders); positive, consistent, and predictable social interaction (acclimating the cat to frequent contact from an early age, speaking softly, and avoiding forced contact); and an environment that allows the cat to use its sense of smell normally (providing scratching posts and other items where it can leave its Various professional organizations have emphasized the importance of and some studies have raised concerns that many cat owners do not provide sufficient environmental enrichment. In an online survey of cat owners, only about half of the respondents reported playing with their cats daily. problems, but these can be prevented by maintaining the cat’s using products specifically designed for cats (products not intended for cats can be toxic to them). In addition to guides for cat owners, guidelines have also been published for of cats under their care. The AAFP and ISFM have issued recommendations for cat-friendly interactions in veterinary clinics. It is adaptable and now present on all continents except , and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the remote Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants. Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands. The unwantedness that leads to the domestic cat being is twofold. As it is little altered from the wildcat, it can readily interbreed with the wildcat. This poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in , and where protected natural areas are close to human-dominated landscapes, such as However, its introduction to places where no native felines are present also contributes to the decline of native species. Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of feral cats are not known, but estimates of the United States feral population range from 25 to 60 million. , which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. , some being fed and given medical attention by volunteers. Public attitudes toward feral cats vary widely, from seeing them as free-ranging pets to regarding them as Cats kill billions of wild birds each year. This feral cat near Domestic cats are a contributing factor to the decline of several species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction. are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless , which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery. In the United States, feral and free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6.3–22.3 billion mammals annually. In Australia, one study found feral cats to kill 466 million reptiles per year. More than 258 reptile species were identified as being predated by cats. throughout the world, and their worldwide population as of 2007 exceeded 500 million. the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the , with 73.8 million cats owned and around 42.2 million households owning at least one cat. , 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world. Cats have been used for millennia to control rodents, notably and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets, stuffed toys, This use has been outlawed in the United States since 2000 and in the European Union (as well as the United Kingdom) since 2007. Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practice of A few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as that of the General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million. made his career photographing cats after his 1949 images of , a stray cat, were published.

The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and of the person. Others might also acquire infections from cat dead cats out of respect in the same way that they mummified people. Some cultures superstitiously attribute good or bad luck to black cats. often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness. The Greek historian reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows. Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of , where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories. Herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats. as pets, which were seen as the ideal rodent-killers. The earliest unmistakable evidence of the Greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from dating to the mid-fifth century BC showing Iokastos and Phalanthos, the legendary founders of respectively, playing with their pet cats. The usual ancient Greek word for 'cat' was , meaning 'thing with the waving tail'. Cats are rarely mentioned in with the Egyptian goddess Bastet, adopting Bastet's associations with cats and ascribing them to Artemis. In , when the deities flee to Egypt and take animal forms, the goddess as the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunters of mice. During the , many of Artemis's associations with cats were grafted onto the Domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms. Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. In Japan, the , the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats. , the first cat was living in the house of the first man . The cat was once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendants of these two animals. It is also written that neither cats nor are represented in the water, while every other animal has an incarnation species in the water. He is reported to have loved cats so much, ""he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it"". The story has no origin in early Muslim writers, and seems to confuse a story of a later (""father of the kitten""), in reference to his documented affection to cats. used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in medieval According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil, and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. Nay not so, (quoth he), for my thought to tell right, The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive List of cat documentaries, television series and cartoons did not conclude a date for genetic divergence, noting from archaeological evidence that ""the broadest range of dates for domestication to be from 11,000 to 4,000 B.P."".
